## Log

1. Began Angela Yu's *"Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 20201"* course on Udemy, which is also itself a #100 Days of Code program. 

2. Went over data types, type conversions, and type casting; got halfway through Section 2 of my Udemy course. 

3. Built a BMI calculator for practicing mathematic operations and type conversions. 

4. Went over F-Strings and number manipulation. 

5. Built a calculator comparing how many days/weeks/months you have left (if you lived to 90 years old). 

6. Built a tip calculator in Python. 

7. Made a repo for my tip calculator; built a BMI calculator, this time using `if`/`elif`/`else` statements. 

8. Had to troubleshoot Replit not working this morning, so today's coding exercises were brief. But today's material continued on `if` statements. 

9. Completed another coding exercise focusing on multiple `if` conditions; added it to my GitHub for prosperity. 

10. Technically a day of no code. Took the day off to recover, listen to the rain before work, and get rested for tomorrow. 

11. Finished Section 3 of my Udemy course, which covered logical operators. 

12. Finished Section 4-3; refactored a "Choose your path" coding exercise; finished adding another code exercise to my GitHub. 

13. Built a simple coin toss script in Python for my course's video on pseudorandom values. 

14. Finished Section 4, and built a Rock/Paper/Scissors game app. 

15. Almost finished Section 5; completed FizzBuzz coding exercise. 

16. Finished Section 5; built a password generator. 

17. Began Section 6, covering function declarations in Python. 

18. Began using `while` loops to practice algorithms with Karel the robot. 

19. Took a personal day for R&R. 

20. Practiced more complex conditionals with Karel in Python. 

21. Finished Section 6, coding an algorithm to get Karel to escape a maze. 

22. Finished modules 7-1 through 7-4 in my Python course. Built a word randomizer component for Hangman game app. 

23. Finished modules 7-4 through 7-7, finishing the section. Built a Hangman game app in Python. 

24. Day of rest. Stressful week -- add +1 day after Day 100 to compensate. 

25. Intro to Positional Arguments and Keyword Arguments; coded an app that calculates how much paint you need to buy, given a random height and width of a wall.
