### R1-D7
Made a repo for my tip calculator; built a BMI calculator, this time using `if`/`elif`/`else` statements. 

### R1-D8
Had to troubleshoot Replit not working this morning, so today's coding exercises were brief. But today's material continued on `if` statements. 

### R1-D9
Completed another coding exercise focusing on multiple `if` conditions; added it to my GitHub for prosperity. 

### R1-D10

### R1-D14
Finished Section 4, and built a Rock/Paper/Scissors game app. 

### R1-D15
Almost finished Section 5; completed FizzBuzz coding exercise. 

### R1-D16
Finished Section 5; built a password generator. 

### R1-D17
Began Section 6, covering function declarations in Python. 

### R1-D18
Began using `while` loops to practice algorithms with Karel the robot. 

### R1-D19
Took a personal day for R&R. 

### R1-D20
Practiced more complex conditionals with Karel in Python. 

### R1-D21
Finished Section 6, coding an algorithm to get Karel to escape a maze. 

### R1-D22
Finished modules 7-1 through 7-4 in my Python course. Built a word randomizer component for Hangman game app. 

### R1-D23
Finished modules 7-4 through 7-7, finishing the section. Built a Hangman game app in Python. 

### R1-D24
Day of rest. Stressful week -- add +1 day after Day 100 to compensate. 

### R1-D25
Intro to Positional Arguments and Keyword Arguments; coded an app that calculates how much paint you need to buy, given a random height and width of a wall.
