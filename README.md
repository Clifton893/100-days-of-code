# 100 Days of Code: Python
This is a repository documenting my 100 Days of Python Code challenge.

Well aware of its value to IT professionals, I had been eyeing Python for a while. While chatting with a confidant one weekend, I decided to begin a personal #100daysofcode challenge and finally learn Python. I enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, and began my hundred-day commitment.

Initially posting my status updates in the freeCodeCamp Discord channel, I decided a public repository would better hold me accountable, as well as provide something tangible to list on my resume's "Projects" section.

While there were many small Replits and coding exercises, many of them were very simple and used only for exploring and illustrating code concepts. I've opted to list complete, well-rounded apps in the repo.
