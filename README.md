# 100 Days of Code: Python
While chatting with a confidant one weekend, I decided to begin a personal #100daysofcode challenge and finally learn Python. I enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, and began my hundred-day commitment. This repository documents that journey.

## Contents
Link to other directories in the repo, here.

While there were many small Replits and coding exercises, many of them were very simple and used only for exploring and illustrating code concepts. I've opted to list complete, well-rounded apps in the repo.
