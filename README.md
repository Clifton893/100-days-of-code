# 100 Days of Code: Python
This is a repository documenting my 100 Days of Python Code challenge.

Well aware of its value to IT professionals, I had been eyeing Python for a while. While chatting with a confidant one weekend, I decided to begin a personal #100daysofcode challenge and finally learn Python. I enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, and began my hundred-day commitment.

Initially posting my status updates in the freeCodeCamp Discord channel, I decided a public repository would better hold me accountable, as well as provide something tangible to list on my resume's "Projects" section.
