# 100 Days of Code: Python
While chatting with a confidant one weekend, I decided to begin a personal #100daysofcode challenge and finally learn Python. I enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, and began my hundred-day commitment. This repository documents that journey.

## Projects 👨‍💻
<!-- List projects here -->

### Additional Code 💾
This repository is for my milestone projects, demonstrating complete Python apps.

While there were many small Replits and coding exercises, many of them were very simple and used only for exploring and illustrating code concepts. In the interest of time, I will not be linking to these in this repo; but they can be found [in my Replit page]().

## Log 📝
