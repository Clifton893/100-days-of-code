# 100 Days of Code: Python
While chatting with a confidant one weekend, I decided to begin a personal #100daysofcode challenge and finally learn Python. I enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy, and began my hundred-day commitment. This repository documents that journey.

## Contents
While there were many small Replits and coding exercises, many of them were very simple and used only for exploring and illustrating code concepts. In the interest of time, I will not be linking to these in this repo; but they can be found [in my Replit page]().
