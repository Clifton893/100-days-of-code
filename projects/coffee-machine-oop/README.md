# Coffee Machine -- Rebuilt with OOP! â˜• ðŸ”§
The Coffee Machine project, simplified with object-oriented programming in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, revising a previous project to demonstrate the power of object-oriented programming. Choose from `latte`, `espresso`, or `cappuccino`; insert your payment; and get your drink!
