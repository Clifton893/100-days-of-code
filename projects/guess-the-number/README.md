# Guess the Number ü§îÔ∏è
A game app where you guess the number, written in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, involving local/global scope, `while` loops, and conditionals. Features easy/hard settings, which tracks the user's guess against the answer and decrements with each try.
