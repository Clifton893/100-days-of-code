# Calculator ðŸ§®
A calculator app, written in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, and implemented dictionaries, while loops, flags, and recursion, to create an addition/subtraction/multiplication/division calculator using floating point numbers.
