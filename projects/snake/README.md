# Snake üêç
An app recreating the legendary [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game in Python!

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, giving hands-on practice with the Turtle Graphics module. By using several modules, the program creates an entirely interactive game of Snake, complete with collision detection and score-keeping.
