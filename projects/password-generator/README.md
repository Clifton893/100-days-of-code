# Password Generator ðŸ”’
A random password generator built with Python, for my 100 Days of Code challenge.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, and tested the student's use of lists, randomization, and `for` loops.
