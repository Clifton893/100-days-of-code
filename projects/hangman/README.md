# Hangman 💀
The word-guessing game Hangman, written in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, and was a comprehensive exam of sorts, covering `for` and `while` loops, `if`/`else` statements, lists, strings, range, and modules.
