# Higher/Lower Game 💫
A game app where you guess whose follower count is higher or lower, written in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, generating a random account from `game_data.py`, comparing account data, checking the users' guess and giving feedback, and repeating the game in a `while` loop.
