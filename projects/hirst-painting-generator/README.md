# Hirst Painting Generator ðŸŽ¨
An app that draws dot paintings -- inspired by Damien Hirst's contemporary art -- by extracting the color palette from an image.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, giving hands-on practice with the Turtle Graphics module. Using the Colorgram library, a jpg image's color palette is extracted; then the Turtle draws dots along a grid by using a `for` loop. It was created locally in PyCharm, as Replit's IDE is too limited to use Turtle Graphics in conjunction with a library.
