# Turtle Race üê¢
An app where turtles race and you can't guess the winner!

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, giving hands-on practice with the Turtle Graphics module. Building off previous Turtle Graphics projects, I imported the random module to create a truly exciting race! It was created locally in PyCharm, as Replit's IDE is too limited to use Turtle Graphics in conjunction with a library.
