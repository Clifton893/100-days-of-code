# Blackjack ♠️
A Blackjack game app, written in Python.

## Description
This was a coding exercise in Angela Yu's terrific [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Python, centering around a function that took a list of cards as input, randomly dealt cards to the player and dealer, while running the game on a `while` loop.
